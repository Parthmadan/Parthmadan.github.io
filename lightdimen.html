                        <p>Is it the thing to which darkness is afraid of?</p>
                        <p>What is light exactly?</p>
                        <p>In general words, it is a form of energy, which gives us sensation of sight. It is the thing to which darkness fears, it’s also the thing that gives us sunburn and it’s also the thing that makes us see things. What we generally see around us is visible spectrum of light. When we talk about light, we’re talking about   visible light, infrared light, Ultraviolet light, gamma rays, x-ray, etc. combined.</p>
                        <p>When a ray of light strikes a surface majority of ray is reflected depending on the nature of surface, that reflected ray of light strikes our eye and boom we see that thing. </p>
                        <p>When a ray enters pupil of eye, the eye lens contracts depending on the intensity of light and rays are focused on retina. Then through retina, the impulse created by rays travels up to the brain and brain creates the image of that object, giving us the vision of the object.
                              Above mentioned is the mechanism of how we see objects with the help of visible light. The mechanism is same for UV, infrared lights, but our brain can’t form image using such rays. Hence world of UV and infrared light is absence for us. Various animals can see those rays and use it for their advantages, like pigeon uses UV rays for determining directions.

                              Moving on visible light, when we wake up in the morning and look towards east, sun rays piercing through clouds and through the hills can be seen coming towards us slowly. Sun is such far away from us, even then the moment sun is seen in the east, light rays already struck us. Even at night, stars which are way larger than sun and are millions of light year far from us can be seen. But a person standing 100m away will hear your voice after some delay and intensity of the sound would’ve reduced a lot. So, what makes light ray so fast and consistent.

                              Light possess dual nature, wave nature and particle nature. </p>

                                            <div class="col-lg-10">
                                            <p><a href="images/duality.jpg" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/duality.jpg" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
                                          </div>
                                          <p> In wave nature, it behaves like waves as you’ve seen up and down continuous curves of sine and cosine in math. And in particle nature, it behaves like a bunch of particles travelling very fast with constant speed. In both properties, its speed is same and is 3*10^8 m/s^2 approx.
                                                         It can be seen that speed of light is quite fast, but how it is so consistent?  Like it travels such a great distance even then its intensity doesn’t seem to reduce. It’s because of its nature. It is an electromagnetic wave meaning it is medium independent and travels due to perpendicular oscillations of magnetic and electric component.

                                                         </p>
                                    <p>Speed of light is so fast that we measure distance between galaxies, stars in terms of light years.  Light year is the distance travelled by light in a year. So we knew how it is consistent but how is it so fast?</p>
                                    <p>Till today, there is no explanation of such huge speed of light. The speed of light is considered as its property so it is so fast because it is of that nature. Such explanations can be found. When a question is raised on something and it turns out that the reason is because of property, the question is ended. it’s funny how we’re unable to explain about the property . Or is it we cannot explain because we can’t sense or its way more complicated. It’s not like no one has conducted a single experiment and research on this, there are many but the conclusion didn’t turn out to be meaningful.</p>
                                    <p>May be reason behind such speed of light is not meant for us. It maybe because the thing as light we see may be a thing carried by another carrier and we are just able to sense the thing carried by the carrier. For example, when a ribbon is attached on a vehicle and vehicle is moved, ribbon moves with the same speed as vehicle .And when the vehicle is made invisible by some means, ribbon floating and moving very fast can only be seen. Similarly, light we see is also like a ribbon carried by another moving body with greater speed.</p>
                                    <p>If so, why can’t we see that carrier?</p>
                                    <p>Here comes a hypothesis of higher dimensional carrier.</p>
                                    <div class="col-lg-15">
                                    <p><a href="images/post_2.jfif" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/post_2.jfif" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
                                  </div>
                                  <p>In this hypothesis, light is carried by a material of higher dimension. Before further explanation, let’s learn about limitation and behavior of our mind.</p>
                                  <h5>Our mind is limited to 3-dimensions. Meaning, we can only see and imagine things up to 3-dimensions. And also another amazing behavior of our mind is that, it is chooses the shortest and easiest way. Like when we imagine a space craft, our mind does not creates new image rather it searches old images that we may have seen related to space craft and according to that it forms image. And the image would be of 3- dimensions cause we have never experienced dimensions higher than 3-d. Even if we see a thing of higher dimension, our mind tends to form that in 3-d and similar to our previous images. For example : if we encounter an alien of 5th dimension , for an instant our mind wouldn’t be able to process that information and after some time mind will render that alien in 3-d image and tries to blend in previous 3-d alien images . This is how our mind works.</h5>

                                <h5>So when light is carried by carrier of higher dimension, that carrier is invisible to our senses and hence we just see light travelling on such great speed.</h5>
